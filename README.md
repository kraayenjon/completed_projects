# completed_projects

Welcome to my **GIF portfolio repository!** Here, I've curated a collection of diverse projects showcasing my proficiency in **Python** and **SQL**.

These projects demonstrate a wide range of skills, including **data cleaning** techniques, **data wrangling**, precise **aggregations**, **filtering** and **sorting**, as well as **plotting**. Each endeavor is a testament to my ability to extract valuable insights from a variety of datasets.

I invite you to explore my repository to witness the power of Python and SQL in action.
